Assignment 2 TEST.txt file
Created by Ben Ribovich

There were four programs tested: birthday_match.sh, count_files.sh, url_search.sh, and spy.sh

1. birthday_match.sh
./birthday_match.sh 
./birthday_match.sh 12/30/2012
./birthday_match.sh 12/30/2012 12/11/2012 12/13/2012
all returned: "Incorrect number of arguments, please enter two dates."

./birthday_match.sh 12/30/2012, 12/13/2012
./birthday_match.sh fjalskdjf alksdjflj
./birthday_match.sh 12/35/2012 12/36/2012 
all returned "Your first date is invalid" 

./birthday_match.s 12/11/2013 12/36/2012
returned "Your second date is invalid"

2. count_files
The program was tested on a directory containing 
asdf.5             count_files.sh  hello..     spy.sh         websites.txt
asdf_ye.g          hello           README.txt  TESTING.txt
birthday_match.sh  hello.          spy.log     url_search.sh

and returned
1 5
1 g
1 log
4 sh
3 txt
3 noext

This shows the effects of having no extension, just "." and ".." at the end, and having underscores in the file name.
The program was also tested on a directory containing other directories in order to ensure that these would not be considered and would be searched.
Finally, the program was tested on a directory containing a file with 2 dots, for instance "a.b.c" in order to ensure only the last extension was counted
3. url_search.sh
./url_search.sh 
./url_search word
./url_search websites.txt
all returned: "Not enough inputs."

./url_search.sh alsd asdf
./url_serach.sh websites.txt word
where websites.txt is blank
and the directory did not contain "alsd"
returned: "File does not exist or has no content."

./url_search.sh websites.txt the program

where: websites.txt is:


http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~jenkins/lab2/potato.html
http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~jenkins/lab2/kludge.html
http://www.cs.datmouth.edu/~jenkins/lab2/programming.html

(i.e. the third url is mispelled)

returned:
http://www.cs.datmouth.edu/~jenkins/lab2/programming.html is not a valid url.

4. spy.sh

./spy.sh
returned: "Not enough inputs."


./spy.sh "Charles C. Paler"
(i.e. no valid usernames)
returned: "No valid users."

./spy.sh "Charles C. Palmer" "Ira Ray Jenkins"
returned: attached "spy.log" file

If a user did not log on, their section of the log states "[user] did not log on at all.
